## � Known Architecture Issues

### 1. Payment Forms Duplication (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Status:** 🔴 Open — [PAYMENT_FORMS_REFACTORING.md](./PAYMENT_FORMS_REFACTORING.md)  
**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours

**Problem:**
- `shared/ui/payment-form/` (270 lines, Smart)
- `areas/account/ui/payment-method-form/` (85 lines, Dumb)
- ~60% code duplication (card inputs, validation, formatting)

**Impact:**
- Violates DRY principle
- Maintenance burden (changes need 2 locations)
- Unclear responsibility boundaries

**Proposed Solution:**
1. Extract `shared/ui/payment-card-fields/` (Dumb UI component)
2. Refactor both components to use shared UI
3. Move orchestration to domain layers

**Blocker:** None — can be done anytime  
**Recommendation:** Complete after orders area decomposition

---

### 2. Orders Area Decomposition (CRITICAL)

**Status:** 🔴 Open — Needs analysis  
**Estimated Effort:** 8-12 hours

**Problem:**
- Orders domain lacks proper FSD decomposition
- Mixed concerns and responsibilities
- `PaymentFormComponent` in `shared/ui/` should be in `areas/orders/ui/`

**Impact:**
- Harder to maintain and extend
- Violates FSD layer boundaries
- Confusing for new developers

**Proposed Solution:**
1. Analyze orders flow and components
2. Create proper FSD structure in `areas/orders/`
3. Move checkout-specific components from `shared/` to `orders/`
4. Separate concerns: widgets, features, entities

**Blocker:** Requires architectural planning  
**Recommendation:** Complete BEFORE payment forms refactoring

**Related:** See [UI_DECOMPOSITION_ANALYSIS.md](./UI_DECOMPOSITION_ANALYSIS.md)

## 🚀 Quick Wins

Easy tasks that add value:

1. **Account profile save** (~1h) - Form ready, just needs BFF call
2. **Permission persistence** (~30min) - Repository exists, just wire it
3. **Dashboard basic stats** (~1h) - Simple count queries
4. **Orders mock → real data** (~1h) - Connect existing BFF

---

**Next recommended task:** Orders area decomposition planning (architectural foundation for future refactoring)
