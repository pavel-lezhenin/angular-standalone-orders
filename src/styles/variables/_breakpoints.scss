/* Responsive Breakpoints
 * 
 * This application uses dynamic CSS classes for responsive design.
 * Classes are added to the <html> element based on viewport width:
 * 
 * - .mobile:  max-width: 600px
 * - .tablet:  min-width: 601px and max-width: 960px
 * - .desktop: min-width: 961px
 * 
 * Usage in component styles:
 * :host-context(.mobile) .element { ... }
 * :host-context(.tablet) .element { ... }
 * :host-context(.desktop) .element { ... }
 * 
 * These classes are managed by app.ts initBreakpoints() method.
 * DO NOT use @media queries directly - always use these classes!
