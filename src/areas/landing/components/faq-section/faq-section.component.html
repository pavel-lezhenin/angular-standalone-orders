        <mat-panel-title> Is my data secure? </mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <p>
        Absolutely. We use industry-standard encryption for data at rest and in transit. Role-based access control
        ensures that users only see data they're authorized to access. Regular security audits keep your data protected.
